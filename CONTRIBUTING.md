# Contributing Guidelines

We welcome everyone to contribute towards the Tebex Project, but doing so will require you to follow specific rules to
keep a consistent and welcoming way of contributing.

## Issues

Like any other project can you encounter bugs or a feature is missing for you in the plugin.  
For that, you can open an [issue] to report a bug, or suggest a new feature to be added.

When doing so, make sure you follow rules below:

### Follow the template

We have issue templates to help us get the required information more easily. Please follow the provided template when
either filing a bug report or feature request.  
Your issue may be closed without warning for not following the template.

### Use the latest version

When it comes to bug reports should you always check first, that you're using the latest release of Tebex.  
Often the bug you've encountered, is fixed in a newer version.

The same rules apply when making a feature request.

### No duplicate issue

Make sure that there aren't any existing issues relating to the problem, which are still open, or are closed with a
solution/explanation.  
Opening a separate issue for a bug report or feature request, that already exists on the issue tracker only slows down
the process of fixing the bug or implementing the feature.

If an issue with the bug or feature you want to report/suggest exists, comment on it with your info (bug reports) or
give it a :thumbsup: (Feature Request) to show that this is important for you.

## Pull requests

As an open source project are we welcoming all contributions to improve Tebex, being it changes to its code, or
contributions to its documentation such as the [Wiki] or the Javadocs.

**When contributing, make sure to both base of and target the mentioned branch. Pull requests targeting the wrong branch
may get closed without a warning.**

### Code contributions
