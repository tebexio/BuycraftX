# BuycraftX [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/20zinnm/BuycraftX.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/20zinnm/BuycraftX)

BuycraftX is an entirely new plugin for use with the [Buycraft.net service](https://www.buycraft.net).

## The major differences

* A total rewrite of the plugin based on modern coding standards. The new plugin is geared towards reliability and performance.
* Supports multiple platforms:
  * Spigot 1.8 or above
  * BungeeCord (recent versions)
  * Sponge (coming soon!)
* Custom item IDs are not supported, as it is not portable to other platforms and is deprecated.
